# 🤝 GoTogether – Share Rides, Split Costs, Make Travel Easy

**GoTogether** is a smart travel coordination app designed to help travelers going to the same destination **connect, share rides, and reduce travel costs** — all while making new connections. Whether you're commuting to college, heading to the airport, or planning a trip, GoTogether makes travel more social, economical, and eco-friendly.
